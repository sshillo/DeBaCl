"""
DeBaCl is a Python library for estimation of density level set trees and
nonparametric density-based clustering. Level set trees are based on the
statistically-principled definition of clusters as modes of a probability
density function. They are particularly useful for analyzing structure in
complex datasets that exhibit multi-scale clustering behavior. DeBaCl is
intended to promote the practical use of level set trees through improvements
in computational efficiency, flexible algorithms, and an emphasis on
modularity and user customizability.
